# Advanced Programming

This repository includes some of the programs created
during a Advanced Programming course that was based on
the Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment book written
by W. Richard Stevens and by Stephen A. Rago. 

These programs are examples of some of the services provided
by the UNIX operating systems.

## Important Notes

All of these programs were tested using using macOS Version 11.4 and the 
Apple clang version 12.0.5 compiler; therefore, there is no guarantee that
they will work correctly on other operating systems or using other compilers.
However, this repository can be a basic guide to some UNIX operating system services.

## Content

- **copy**: similar to the cp program, but it can also copy a specific range of the file.
- **decrypt**: example of bit manipulation to decrypt a file.
- **descending**: creating a tree of processes.
- **execute**: use of signals and executing programs in child processes.
- **find**: recursive search of a substring in the name of the files.
- **mini-shell**: simple example of how a shell works.
- **processes**: use of processes for different tasks and synchronization with signals.
- **threads**: concurrency with threads for calculating a matrix multiplication.
